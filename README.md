This is a Final Project of ISE540 in USC which is about the NLP(Natural Language Processing).

## Project Description
I get the topic from a [kaggle competiition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started) which is a simple binary classification.

Although it is just a final project of the class, I think it is a good opportunity to follow a real workflow used in the industrial field.

The workflow is as follow:

**Dataset** -> **Data Preprocessing** -> **Annotation(Labeling)** -> **EDA** -> **Model Selection** -> **Model Fine-tuning** -> **Evaluation** 

I will introduce what we have done in each part and break them down. Hope it will help you to understand our project and code.

## BreakDown Details
### Datasets
Data Source: Twitter Texts

Approach: Web crawler ([code_source](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1mx4y1t7Uo/?spm_id_from=333.1007.top_right_bar_window_history.content.click&vd_source=e4945a960ebe99f5b861521b8f23add7))

Brief Explanation
In this part, we use web crawler to get some Twitter Texts. Because I am not familiar with the web crawler and what the operation of how to transfer the web data, I find the code on the Bilibili which is a Chinese video platform. Some details are expained in the video (HyperLink above)
