A “disaster” typically results in infrastructure damage, environmental degradation, casualties, or health threats, and it is a sudden event that requires urgent response and assistance.\n\n[Class]\n1. \"1\" (\"1\" means the query is related to the disaster)\n2. \"0\" (\"0\" means the query is unrelated to the disaster)\n\n[Requirements]\n1.

If there is no location or disaster entity in query, please leave the result empty (like \"\")\n4. Please only generate the JSON, you are forbidden to generate any of your own understanding and explanation.\n5. The classification result must come from [Class].
